# Dataset description: Athletes' performance during two sporting meetings
data(decathlon2)
# View type of the dataset
str(decathlon2)
# Will use a subset dataset 
decathlon2.subset <- decathlon2[1:27, 1:10]
# View first 6 elements
head(decathlon2.subset[, 1:6])

# Compute PCA
pca.out <- prcomp(decathlon2.subset, scale = TRUE)
# View strucutre pca.out object
str(pca.out)

### Understanding the result using factoextra package and visualization

# Calculated as follows 
# pca.var <- pca.ou$sdev^2
# pca.var.per <- round(pca.var/sum(pca.var)*100, 1)
# get_eigenvalue: Used Extract the eigenvalues/variances of principal components
eig.val <- get_eigenvalue(pca.out)
eig.val

# Visualize eigenvalues (scree plot)
# Used to detrmine how many PC components are enough
# From this plot we might make first 3-4 componets represent well to this data
fviz_eig(pca.out,main = "Scree Plot")
